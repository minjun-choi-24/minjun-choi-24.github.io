  <h1>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs ids?</h1>

  <body>
    <h2>What Are Classes and IDs?</h2>
    <p>
      Let's say that you are decorating a house. You have different rooms and
      you want to style them in various ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      -Classes are like general decorations i.e. kitchen-style decoration or
      bedroom-style decoration
    </p>
    <p>
      -IDs are like unique decorations. These are one of a kind items designated
      specifically for a certain room i.e. waterproof-bathroom-painting
    </p>
    <h2>When to Use Each?</h2>
    <p>
      Classes are used when you want to apply the same style to several rooms.
      For example if you want beige colored curtains in all rooms, you would
      apply the "room-curtain" style to all bedroom windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      IDs are used for items that are unique and appears only once, like a
      special portrait of your dog displayed in the kitchen. It is not ideal to
      use ID for everything as your room becomes too specific -making things
      complicated when you want to apply similar styles to multiple rooms
