    <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence (EQ) refers to the ability to recognize, understand, manage, and influence emotions in oneself and others. It involves skills like self-awareness, empathy, emotional regulation, and social awareness. EQ helps people navigate social interactions, maintain positive relationships, and handle challenging situations with emotional resilience.
      </p>
    <h2>How is EQ different from IQ?</h1>
      <p>
        EQ and IQ measure different aspects of intelligence. IQ (Intelligence Quotient) assesses cognitive abilities like problem-solving, logic, and analytical thinking, while EQ focuses on emotional and interpersonal skills. IQ relates more to academic and intellectual success, whereas EQ is about managing emotions and relationships effectively.
      </p>
    <h2>Why is EQ important?</h1>
      <p>
        EQ is crucial for both personal and professional success. People with high EQ communicate better, manage stress, resolve conflicts, and collaborate effectively in teams. EQ fosters leadership, empathy, and resilience, which are vital for building trust, inspiring others, and navigating social dynamics in the workplace and beyond.
      </p>
    <h2>How to Develop EQ</h1>
      <p>
        As opposed to IQ, which has a stronger genetic component, EQ can be developed through practice and self-awareness. To improve EQ, start by focusing on self-awarenessâ€”pay attention to your emotions, triggers, and reactions in different situations. Developing empathy is also key; try to understand others' perspectives and emotions. Practicing emotional regulation, such as pausing before reacting, can help you respond more thoughtfully. Additionally, improving your social skills by engaging in active listening, clear communication, and conflict resolution will enhance your ability to navigate relationships more effectively over time.
