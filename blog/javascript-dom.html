  <h1>Understanding JavaScript: A Friendly Guide for Beginners</h1>
  <body>
    <h2>JavaScript, HTML, and CSS: The Trio of Web Development</h2>
    <p>
      Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage—it's what holds everything in
      place. CSS is like the clothing and makeup that make it look nice.
      JavaScript, on the other hand, is like the magic that makes it
      interactive.
    </p>
    <h2>Control Flow and Loops: A Simple Analogy</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine you're preparing breakfast. Here’s how you might use a loop to
      simplify the process:
      <br />
      Control Flow: Deciding what to do based on conditions. If it’s a weekend,
      you might make pancakes. If it's a weekday, you might just have cereal.
      <br />
      Loop: Repeating a task. If you have multiple eggs to cook, you'd cook each
      egg one after another. In JavaScript, this is similar to a loop that
      processes each item in an array.
      <br />
      <br />
      Example:
      <br />
      <img src="../screenshots/control-flow.png" alt="control-flow" />
      <br />
      This loop would print out each day of the week from the days array
    </p>

    <h2>The DOM: Your Webpage’s Inner Workings</h2>
    <p>
      The DOM (Document Object Model) is like a map of your webpage that
      JavaScript can use to make changes. Think of it as a live representation
      of your HTML that you can interact with.
      <br />
      <br />
      Example:
      <br />
      Imagine you have a button on your webpage:
      <br />
      <img src="../screenshots/button.png" alt="button" />
      <br />
      Using JavaScript, you can interact with this button:
      <br />
      <img src="../screenshots/interact-button.png" alt="interact-button" />
      <br />
      Here, you've used JavaScript to tell the button what to do when it's
      clicked.
    </p>
    <h2>Arrays vs. Objects: Accessing Data</h2>
    <p>
      Arrays: Think of arrays as a list of items, like a shopping list. You
      access items by their position (index) in the list.
      <br />
      <br />
      Example:
      <br />
      <img src="../screenshots/array.png" alt="array" />
      <br />
      Objects: Objects are like a contact list where each contact has a name and
      phone number. You access information by its label (key).
      <br />
      <br />
      Example:
      <br />
      <img src="../screenshots/object.png" alt="object" />
    </p>

    <h2>Functions: The Helpers</h2>
    <p>
      Functions are like mini-programs that do specific tasks. They make your
      code reusable and organized.
      <br />
      <br />
      Example:
      <br />
      <img src="../screenshots/function.png" alt="function" />
      <br />
      Here, the greet function takes a name and returns a greeting. You can use
      this function whenever you need a greeting, just by calling it with a
      different name.
