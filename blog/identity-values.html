  <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
  <body>
    <h2>An Ethical Decision I Made</h1>
      <p>During a group project, a teammate suggested cutting corners by not properly citing sources. I stood by my values of honesty and integrity, deciding we should do the work correctly, even if it meant more effort. Looking back, I believe it was the right choice for long-term accountability.

      </p>
    <h2>Cultural and Social Influence on My Values</h1>
      <p>
        My upbringing emphasized community, empathy, and perseverance, values that continue to guide me. Family and mentors have encouraged me to prioritize learning and hard work, shaping my approach to both life and my career.
      </p>
    <h2>My Strengths and How They Support My Learning Journey</h1>
      <p>
        One of my strengths is adaptability, which helps me quickly learn and apply new concepts. My creativity allows me to think outside the box when solving problems, which will be key to overcoming challenges in my learning journey.
      </p>
    <h2>Recognizing My Limitations</h1>
      <p>
        Procrastination is a significant challenge for me, often leading to stress. I am working on managing my time better and setting small, achievable goals to stay on track.
      </p>
    <h2>Working with Others: Managing Resistance and Tension</h1>
      <p>
        In a previous project, I faced resistance when proposing a new workflow. I tried explaining my reasoning, but looking back, I realize I should have listened more to my teammates' concerns and collaborated better on finding a solution.
