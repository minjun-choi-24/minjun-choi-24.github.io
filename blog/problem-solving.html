  <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
  <body>
    <h2>A Time I Was Blocked on a Simple Problem</h1>
      <h3>The Problem:</h3>
      <p>
        I remember a frustrating day when I was trying to figure out a bug in my code that was supposed to sort a list of names alphabetically. It seemed like a simple task, but I kept getting unexpected results. Names were appearing in the wrong order, and I couldn’t pinpoint why.
      </p>

      <h3>Problem-Solving Techniques:</h3>
      <p>
        To tackle this issue, I tried breaking the problem down into smaller parts. First, I wrote pseudocode to outline the steps I thought my sorting algorithm should follow. Then, I used console.logging to print out the intermediate results at various stages of my function. I also Googled similar sorting algorithms to see if I could identify what I was missing.
      </p>

      <h3>How I Felt:</h3>
      <p>
        Initially, I felt overwhelmed and a bit defeated, especially when nothing seemed to work. After a few hours of trial and error, I started feeling a little more optimistic as I implemented each change and saw small improvements. Eventually, when I found the error, I felt a rush of relief and satisfaction.
      </p>

      <h3>What I learned:</h3>
      <p>
        This experience taught me the importance of patience and the value of breaking down problems. I realized that even simple problems can become complex and that systematic troubleshooting is often the key to finding a solution.
      </p>


    <h2>A Time I Elegantly Solved a Problem</h2>
      <h3>The Problem:</h3>
      <p>I was working on a JavaScript project where I needed to filter an array of objects based on specific criteria. The objects contained various properties, and I needed to find the first object that had a property value of "Scooby" in a large dataset. Initially, my attempts to loop through the array manually led to complicated and messy code.</p>

      <h3>Problem-Solving Techniques</h3>
      <p>To simplify the solution, I decided to use the .find() method, which allows for cleaner and more readable code when searching through arrays. I wrote a concise function that utilized this method, returning the first matching object based on the specified criteria.</p>

      <h3>How I Felt</h3>
      <p>At first, I felt overwhelmed by the complexity of the problem. However, once I researched the array methods available in JavaScript and implemented .find(), I felt a sense of clarity and satisfaction. The solution was not only elegant but also efficient.</p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <p>This experience reinforced the importance of leveraging built-in methods in programming to write cleaner, more efficient code. It showed me that sometimes, the simplest solutions are the most effective, and using the right tools can significantly enhance the coding process.</p>

    <h2>Reflecting on Problem-Solving Techniques</h2>
      <h3>1. Pseudocode:</h3>
      <p>I feel quite confident using pseudocode. It helps me outline my thoughts and plan my approach without getting lost in syntax.</p>
      <h3>2. Trying Something:</h3>
      <p>I’m generally comfortable with trying different solutions, although it can be intimidating when I’m unsure.</p>
      <h3>3. Rubber Ducky Method</h3>
      <p>This method I have not used at all as I felt awkward talking to an inanimate object. I might as well give it a go and reflect back on it in my future reflections</p>
      <h3>4. Reading Error Messages:</h3>
      <p>I’ve become better at interpreting error messages over time, though they still occasionally confuse me.</p>
      <h3>5. Console.logging:</h3>
      <p>Console.logging is one of my go-to techniques. It’s straightforward and gives immediate feedback.</p>
      <h3>6. Googling</h3>
      <p>I rely heavily on Googling. It feels empowering to find solutions online, and I’ve learned to use specific keywords for better results.</p>
      <h3>7. Asking Peers for Help:</h3>
      <p>I’m somewhat hesitant to ask peers for help, as I don’t want to feel like a burden. However, I recognize the value of collaboration.</p>
      <h3>8. Asking Coaches for Help:</h3>
      <p>I feel more comfortable asking coaches for help, as they were nothing but helpful and very supportive</p>
      <h3>9. Improving with Reflection:</h3>
      <p>Reflecting on my process has become a valuable tool for me. I often review what worked and what didn’t to improve future problem-solving.</p>

    <h2>Reflecting on Reluctance to Ask for Help</h2>
    <p>During one of the Kata exercises, I was stuck on a specific question as the test did not pass despite me being confident in my answers. As it was 2AM in the morning I was reluctant on asking on discord so I stayed stuck until i tweaked the import description. The test did pass but I still am not sure if I was allowed to do that. If similar problems requiring solutions as such arise, I feel like I would save a couple of hours if I seek assistance in the future.</p>
