  <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
  <body>
    <h2>A Time I Was Blocked on a Simple Problem</h1>
      <h3>The Problem:</h3>
      <p>
        I remember a frustrating day when I was trying to figure out a bug in my code that was supposed to sort a list of names alphabetically. It seemed like a simple task, but I kept getting unexpected results. Names were appearing in the wrong order, and I couldn’t pinpoint why.
      </p>

      <h3>Problem-Solving Techniques:</h3>
      <p>
        To tackle this issue, I tried breaking the problem down into smaller parts. First, I wrote pseudocode to outline the steps I thought my sorting algorithm should follow. Then, I used console.logging to print out the intermediate results at various stages of my function. I also Googled similar sorting algorithms to see if I could identify what I was missing.
      </p>

      <h3>How I Felt:</h3>
      <p>
        Initially, I felt overwhelmed and a bit defeated, especially when nothing seemed to work. After a few hours of trial and error, I started feeling a little more optimistic as I implemented each change and saw small improvements. Eventually, when I found the error, I felt a rush of relief and satisfaction.
      </p>

      <h3>What I learned:</h3>
      <p>
        This experience taught me the importance of patience and the value of breaking down problems. I realized that even simple problems can become complex and that systematic troubleshooting is often the key to finding a solution.
      </p>


    <h2>A Time I Elegantly Solved a Problem</h2>
      <h3>The Problem:</h3>
      <p>Another time, I was tasked with creating a simple web form for user feedback. I wanted to ensure that all user inputs were validated before submission. Instead of writing complex validation rules for each field, I aimed for a more elegant solution.</p>

      <h3>Problem-Solving Techniques</h3>
      <p>I decided to utilize regular expressions for validating inputs. I started by drafting pseudocode that laid out my validation logic clearly. I also wrote a simple helper function that checked the validity of the inputs and returned error messages if necessary. This made my code more reusable and cleaner.</p>

      <h3>How I Felt</h3>
      <p>The process felt smooth and enjoyable. I was in a flow state as I saw my ideas come together. When I finally tested the form and everything worked seamlessly, I felt accomplished and proud of my clean solution.</p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <p>This situation taught me that sometimes taking a step back and thinking critically about a problem can lead to elegant and efficient solutions. It reinforced my belief in the power of planning before diving into coding.</p>

    <h2>Reflecting on Problem-Solving Techniques</h2>
      <h3>1. Pseudocode:</h3>
      <p>I feel quite confident using pseudocode. It helps me outline my thoughts and plan my approach without getting lost in syntax.</p>
      <h3>2. Trying Something:</h3>
      <p>I’m generally comfortable with trying different solutions, although it can be intimidating when I’m unsure.</p>
      <h3>3. Rubber Ducky Method</h3>
      <p>This method I have not used at all as I felt awkward talking to an inanimate object. I might as well give it a go and reflect back on it in my future reflections</p>
      <h3>4. Reading Error Messages:</h3>
      <p>I’ve become better at interpreting error messages over time, though they still occasionally confuse me.</p>
      <h3>5. Console.logging:</h3>
      <p>Console.logging is one of my go-to techniques. It’s straightforward and gives immediate feedback.</p>
      <h3>6. Googling</h3>
      <p>I rely heavily on Googling. It feels empowering to find solutions online, and I’ve learned to use specific keywords for better results.</p>
      <h3>7. Asking Peers for Help:</h3>
      <p>I’m somewhat hesitant to ask peers for help, as I don’t want to feel like a burden. However, I recognize the value of collaboration.</p>
      <h3>8. Asking Coaches for Help:</h3>
      <p>I feel more comfortable asking coaches for help, as they were nothing but helpful and very supportive</p>
      <h3>9. Improving with Reflection:</h3>
      <p>Reflecting on my process has become a valuable tool for me. I often review what worked and what didn’t to improve future problem-solving.</p>

    <h2>Reflecting on Reluctance to Ask for Help</h2>
    <p>During one of the Kata exercises, I was stuck on a specific question as the test did not pass despite me being confident in my answers. As it was 2AM in the morning I was reluctant on asking on discord so I stayed stuck until i tweaked the import description. The test did pass but I still am not sure if I was allowed to do that. If similar problems requiring solutions as such arise, I feel like I would save a couple of hours if I seek assistance in the future.</p>
