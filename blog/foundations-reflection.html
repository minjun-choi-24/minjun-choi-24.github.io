  <h1>Reflection on Human Skills Learning</h1>
  <body>
    <h2>Three New Learnings About Myself and My Ego</h1>
      <p>
        Through the Human Skills learning in Foundations, I discovered that I often underestimate my ability to adapt and grow in challenging situations. I realized that my ego can sometimes hinder my openness to feedback, but embracing a growth mindset has helped me see failures as opportunities for learning. Additionally, I learned that self-compassion plays a crucial role in my journey, allowing me to navigate setbacks with more resilience.
      </p>
    <h2>The Role of Values, Empathy, and Self-Awareness in Learning and Programming</h1>
      <p>
        Values guide our actions and decisions, influencing how we approach problem-solving and teamwork. Empathy enhances collaboration, fostering an environment where ideas can flourish. Self-awareness allows us to recognize our strengths and weaknesses, enabling us to leverage our unique skills in programming and contribute more effectively to projects.
      </p>
    <h2>Surprising Aspects of Human Skills Learning</h1>
      <p>
        What surprised me the most was how much my mindset affects my learning process. Understanding that intelligence and abilities can be developed transformed how I approach challenges. This shift in perspective made me more willing to engage with difficult material, knowing that persistence would lead to improvement.
      </p>
    <h2>Challenging Aspects of Human Skills Learning</h1>
      <p>
        The most challenging aspect was confronting my fixed mindset tendencies. It was uncomfortable to acknowledge my resistance to failure and the fear of looking incompetent. However, this discomfort has been a catalyst for growth, pushing me to embrace challenges rather than shy away from them.
      </p>

    <h2>The Importance of Human Skills in a Programming Bootcamp</h1>
      <p>
        Focusing on Human Skills in a programming school like ours is essential because technical skills alone aren't sufficient for success in the tech industry. Effective communication, collaboration, and emotional intelligence are critical for working in teams and navigating the complexities of software development.
      </p>

   <h2>Value of Studying Human Skills</h1>
      <p>
        The time spent on Human Skills learning feels far from wasted. The insights and tools gained have equipped me to approach both programming and collaboration with a more open and adaptive mindset. As I look forward to the in-person bootcamp, I feel more prepared to integrate these skills into my learning and interactions with peers.
