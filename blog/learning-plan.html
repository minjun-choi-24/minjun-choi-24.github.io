  <h1>My Learning PLan</h1>

  <body>
    My long-term goal is to ideally use AI as a tool to become a full-stack
    developer, transitioning into an indie game developer after gaining
    experience in the field. I believe my biggest strength is the ability to
    apply new concepts to similar problems/situations to solidify my knowledge.
    My biggest weakness is that I procrastinate a lot and struggle with
    deadlines. I think teamwork is what I value most in Dev Academy, as it is
    hard to find team projects while studying alone. I have started applying the
    normal bootcamp working hours (9-5 pm) to fix my sleep schedule. I am hoping
    this will boost my productivity in the long run. Things have already been
    piling up, and I am struggling to keep up. I believe pushing through the
    content will help me overcome this, rather than worrying about how far
    behind I am. Through Discord, I will contact my cohort facilitator if I feel
    too stuck or behind. So far, the facilitation team has been superb, and I
    couldnâ€™t ask for more. During the bootcamp study period, I do not have any
    other commitments to attend to.
